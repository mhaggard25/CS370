# CS370

* Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  * In this project, I developed an intelligent agent that navigates a game world that contains obstacles and paths. I was given a Python file that contained a TreasureMaze class that represents the environment that includes a maze object defined as a matrix. I was also given a Python file that defines a Game Experience class that stores all of the episodes. Finally, I was given a Jupyter Notebook file that contains starter code for the implementation of the intelligent agent. I created the algorithm that trains the agent. 

* Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  * What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
    * Computer scientists are professionals who work with computer technology, software, and hardware. They develop and improve computer algorithms, programming languages, data structures, and computer systems. Computer scientists also study the theoretical foundations of computation and devise new computational techniques. Computer scientists play a critical role in the technology industry as they help drive innovation and create new solutions to solve problems. They work in a variety of fields, such as software development, artificial intelligence, robotics, cybersecurity, data analytics, and many more.
